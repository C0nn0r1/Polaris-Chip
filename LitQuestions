1. When doing the tutorial, what did you get stuck on?
Ig get stuck msotly on jsut remembering what the name of a code imeplemtation is or forget the correct syntax.
2. In reading through the deck / tutorials / googling, what's not making sense?
Sometimes event chekcers can be difficult especially when it comes to understanding how they fit into the application.
3. Same, but what DOES make sense? Is this a superior approach to coding in the 'global scope' ala code pen, or does this scoping make it more complicated?
If more compplicated, what makes it harder? If superior approach, why did you feel this was easier than the code pen based global way?
Most of the basic code calls and extensions make sense because I have taken java before. I honestly like codepen more right now because it sperates the code and io see how each one works however I cna see how a more advanced javascript writer would want them all together for the ease of writing it.
